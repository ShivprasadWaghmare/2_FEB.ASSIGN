    "when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code. It's great for iterating over a sequence of elements, like a list.\n",

    "When to use a while loop:\n",
    "Use a while loop when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It's useful when you don't know in advance how many times the code needs to be repeated.\n",
